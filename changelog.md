## Changelog - Rembrandt

### v0.3.1 - 19th February 2026

- Self-refinement pass on Claude settings:
  - `committing.md`: fixed step 6 (two-step: `uv sync --all-extras` for
    lock file, then `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` for editable install),
    replaced generic commit examples with project-relevant ones.
  - `versioning.md`: fixed opening line to match commit workflow order.
  - `testing.md`: replaced naming examples from another project with
    Rembrandt ones, removed duplicate "Running Tests" section.
  - `CLAUDE.md`: added examples/ numeric-prefix naming convention.


### v0.3.0 - 19th February 2026

- Added `docs/` folder with theory documentation:
  - `spaced-repetition.md`: forgetting curve, SM-2 algorithm,
    easiness factor, quality scores, worked example.
  - `exercise-types.md`: active recall, flashcard vs. multiple
    choice, answer evaluation.
- Updated `README.md`: added Documentation section.


### v0.2.5 - 19th February 2026

- Fixed double backticks in docstrings across `db.py`, `models.py`,
  and `session.py` to use single backticks per code style rules.

- Updated `CLAUDE.md`: added rule to never use
  `from __future__ import annotations`.


### v0.2.3 - 19th February 2026

  (unnecessary with Python >= 3.13).
